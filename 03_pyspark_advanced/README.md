# PySpark DataFrames Advanced

Welcome to the PySpark DataFrames Advanced module! ✴️

In this module, we will explore more advanced operations on PySpark DataFrames, including window functions, complex data types, and user-defined functions (UDFs).


## Submodules

### 1. Window Functions

Window functions in PySpark enable complex aggregations and ranking operations over data partitions. They provide a way to perform calculations that involve aggregating data across a group of rows related to the current row. Examples include computing moving averages, cumulative sums, and ranking based on specific criteria.

### 2. Complex Data Types: Arrays, Structs, and Maps

PySpark supports complex data types such as arrays, structs, and maps within its DataFrame API. These data types allow for representing and manipulating heterogeneous and nested data structures efficiently. This capability is particularly useful for scenarios involving JSON data, nested records, and semi-structured data formats.

### 3. User-Defined Functions (UDFs) and Pandas UDFs

UDFs in PySpark enable custom transformations and computations that are not supported by built-in functions. They provide flexibility in processing data at row level, applying business logic, and performing specialized calculations. Pandas UDFs extend this functionality by allowing seamless integration with pandas DataFrames, improving performance for certain operations that benefit from pandas' rich ecosystem of libraries.

## Running the Notebooks

All notebooks in this module are designed to be run in the **Databricks Community Edition**. Detailed steps to set up and configure your environment are provided in the first module.

If you need, go back to `2-Databricks-Environment` notebook in module `01_spark_intro` and follow the instructions there to ensure you have the necessary setup to run these notebooks successfully.
