This data is similar to what you deal with in your day-to-day work as a data analyst.\n",

    "Throughout the notebooks, you will be asked to complete a series of tasks and answer questions. Youâ€™ll encounter empty cells where you need to implement the solution, as well as commented-out cells that you should uncomment and fill in with your responses. Afterward, assertion cells will check whether you've completed the tasks correctly.\n",

    "- **visitorId**: The unique identifier for a visitor\n",
    "- **visitNumber**: The visit number of this visitor. If this is the first visit to the website, then this is set to 1.\n",
    "- **visitStartTime**: The timestamp (expressed as POSIX time) of the beginning of the session\n",
    "- **totals**: A struct with statistics about the session, such as total number of hits, time on site, number of transactions and revenue, etc.\n",
    "- **channelGrouping**: The channel via which the user came to the Store\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hits dataset:**\n",
    "Besides the session id, the hits dataset contains the following column:\n",
    "- **hits**: An array of structs representing all the hits in this session. A hit is an interaction that results in data being sent to Google Analytics. It can either be a page visit or an interaction with some page element. Each struct is a hit defined by the following fields:\n",
    "    - **hitNumber**: The number of this hit in the session\n",
    "    - **type**: Type of the hit: 'PAGE' (Page visit) or 'EVENT' (Interaction with some element on the page)\n",
    "    - **hour**: Hour of the hit\n",
    "    - **minute**: Minute of the hit\n",
    "    - **time**: Time spent on the hit\n",
    "    - **page**: Structured information about the page\n",
    "    - **contentGroup**: Information about the content categorization of the page on the website\n",
    "    - **product**: Array of structs with product information of all products displayed on the page\n",
    "    - **eventInfo**: If hit is of type 'EVENT', this field contains information about the event\n",
    "    - **promotion**: Array of structs with promotion information of all promotions displayed on the page.\n",
    "    - **promotionActionInfo**: Present when there is a promotion on the hit. It explains whether the promotion was clicked (which corresponds to a hit of type 'EVENT' and this event is a 'Promotion Click'), or the promotion is just viewed on the page but was not clicked. \n",
    "    - **transaction**: Information about the transaction when the hit is an event 'Confirm Checkout'. Null otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Network dataset:** Besides the session id, the network dataset contains the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **trafficSource**: A struct with information about the source of the session, as well as adds and campaign information\n",
    "- **device**: A struct with information about the device used in the session\n",
    "- **geoNetwork**: A struct with information about the geographic location of the user. Most of this information is obscured and only city, country and country are available.\n",
