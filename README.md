# lp-big-data

Welcome to the Big Data specialization!

This collection of modules is designed to help you learn how to work with Big Data using Apache Spark and PySpark. The modules cover a range of topics, from the basics of Spark to more advanced concepts. Each module includes hands-on exercises to help you practice and understand the material, giving you the skills you need to manage and analyze large datasets effectively.


## Modules

1. **Spark Introduction**

    Covers the basics of Apache Spark, including its architecture, key components, and the fundamentals of working with Spark to handle Big Data. Also introduces the Databricks environment and PySpark RDDs.

2. **PySpark DataFrames**

    Explores the creation and manipulation of DataFrames in PySpark for data processing and analysis.

3. **PySpark Advanced**

    Introduces advanced PySpark topics such as User-Defined Functions (UDFs), window functions, and working with complex data structures like arrays and structs.

4. **Final Project**

    Final project that combines all the concepts learned in the previous modules to analyze a real-world dataset using PySpark. The dataset is the [Google Analytics Sample dataset](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/obfuscated-ga360-data/obfuscated-ga360-data?inv=1&invt=AbmlmQ), which contains real data from the [Google Merchandise Store](https://shop.googlemerchandisestore.com/), a real ecommerce store that sells Google-branded merchandise. The project is divided into three parts: data understanding, cleaning and analysis; advanced analytics; and sequential analysis.


## Running Notebooks in Databricks Community Edition

These notebooks are expected to be run in the **Databricks Community Edition**. Detailed steps to set up and configure your environment are provided within the notebooks. Follow these instructions to ensure you have the necessary setup to run the notebooks successfully.
